<p>These days I’m working on an <strong>HTTP server in C using WebSockets</strong>, just to get a taste of how things work under the hood.<br>
The only functionality of the server is to listen for incoming requests and send HTML and media files.</p>
<p>Cloud services have become extremely popular due to accessibility, scalability, and the fact that real hardware is abstracted away from developers.<br>
I wanted to see for myself what it’s like to <strong>self-host on a bare-metal server</strong> — even though it’s a small project.</p>
<p>At this point, my servers are sitting idle anyway, so <strong>why not?</strong></p>

<p>I over <strong>simplified</strong> all the steps which it took me hours to figure it out! but once you get it that it ;)
If you are planning to self-host your personal projects, the steps are pretty much the same for any vps or physical machines
<strong>all you need is a host.</strong></p>

<p>You can rent a VPS from popular providers such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linode</li>
<li>AWS EC2 or similar cloud services</li>
<li>DigitalOcean</li>

<h3 id="for-front-end-developers">For Front-End Developers<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#for-front-end-developers">#</a></h3>
<p>You probably don’t want to manage your own server.<br>
In that case, serverless platforms handle deployment automatically.</p>
<p>These are the easiest options for frontend-focused developers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vercel</strong></li>
<li><strong>Netlify</strong></li>
<li><strong>AWS Amplify</strong></li>

<h3 id="2connecting-to-the-internet">2.connecting to the internet<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2connecting-to-the-internet">#</a></h3>
<p>I had no idea where to begin, so I researched for a couple of days about self-hosting.<br>
Here’s what I concluded:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hosting typically involves <strong>port forwarding</strong></li>
<li>You need a <strong>static IP</strong></li>
<li>Most telecom providers don’t give static IPv4 addresses for home consumers</li>
<li>Because they use <strong>CGNAT</strong> (Carrier-Grade NAT)</li>
</ul>
<p>Even I didn’t know what that actually meant .</p>
<p>Then I discovered <strong>web tunnels</strong>, where you forward all incoming traffic to a server running on your localhost.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Tunnels are okay for demos.<br>
Not recommended for production if you expect a significant amount of traffic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>so i created a tunnel service on <strong>cloudflare</strong> (free of cost btw) and run the cloudflared(dameon)
<strong>basically</strong> a way of communication between my machine to the cloudflare servers that gonna forward the request running on specific port on my local machine
Everything <strong>worked fine</strong>, and now I just needed a process that always runs on boot without user interaction — a <strong>daemon process</strong> in Linux.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="daemon">Daemon<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#daemon">#</a></h3>
<p><img alt="Alt text" loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/risvn/blog/refs/heads/main/media/daemon.jpg" title="always running process in the background"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A daemon is a background process that handles requests for services like file transfers, printing, or managing network connections — kind of like a waiter at a restaurant, serving requests without you ever noticing.<br>
The word itself comes from ancient Greek, meaning an attendant spirit.<br>
Invisible, but always there.<br>
My daemon — it’s always there too. Watching. Guiding. Sometimes I think about how much like them I am… always running in the background.”<br>

<p>I SSH’d into my remote machine (btw, SSH also has its own daemon called <strong>sshd</strong>, which listens for incoming connections.
Here’s what I learned about making a daemon service of your own:</p>
