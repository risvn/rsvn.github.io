<p>You probably don’t want to manage your own server.
In that case, you can go with <strong>serverless platforms</strong>, which handle deployment automatically.</p>
<p>These are the easiest options for frontend-focused developers.
Popular options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vercel</strong></li>
<li><strong>Netlify</strong></li>
<li><strong>AWS Amplify</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Though most of these services are basically just wrappers around AWS, offering a nicer UI and developer experience while charging more for the convenience.</p>
<hr>
<p>The thing is, I had <strong>no idea where to begin</strong>, so I researched for a couple of days about how to self-host.<br>
Here’s what I concluded:</p>
<p>Typically, the process involves <strong>port forwarding</strong> and requires a <strong>static IP</strong>.<br>
Guess what? Most telecom services don’t provide static IPv4 for home consumers since they’re behind CGNAT.<br>
Even I didn’t know what that actually mean.</p>
<p>Then I came to know about <strong>web tunnels</strong>, where you can <strong>forward all incoming requests</strong> to a server running on your <strong>localhost</strong>.</p>
<p>NOTE:Tunnels are okay for deploying demo not recommended for the production in case you have consider amount of traffic on your site</p>
<p>Everything worked fine, and now I just had to create a process that <strong>always runs in the background on boot</strong> — without any user intervention.<br>
This is what’s called a <strong>daemon process</strong> in Linux.</p>
<p><img alt="daemon" loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/risvn/blog/refs/heads/main/media/daemon.jpg"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A daemon is a background process that handles requests for services like file transfers, printing, or managing network connections — kind of like a waiter at a restaurant, serving requests without you ever noticing.<br>
The word itself comes from the ancient Greek meaning <em>an attendant spirit.</em><br>
Invisible, but always there.<br>
My daemon — it’s always there too. Watching. Guiding. Sometimes I think about how much like them I am&hellip; always running in the background.”<br>

<h3 id="creating-your-own-daemon">Creating your own daemon<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#creating-your-own-daemon">#</a></h3>
<p>So I SSH’d into my remote machine (btw, SSH also has its own daemon process called <strong>sshd</strong>, which always listens for incoming connections).<br>
Here’s what I learned about making a daemon service of your own:</p>
<p>Create a new service file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>   sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/&lt;name&gt;.service
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Configure it with your executable path, working directory, and restart policy.
from this point managing the service process are same as any other daemon process</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>1.sudo systemctl start &lt;service name&gt;      
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>2.sudo systemctl status &lt;service name&gt;    
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>3.sudo systemctl enable &lt;service name&gt;      
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>if you got any problem activating service.<br>
try</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>sudo journalctl -xe
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>which is also a daemon process which keeps logs of the other daemons.<br>
its not that hard it is truly <strong>rewarding</strong> spinning up own servers</p>
